Release process
===============

The RapidSMS release process, like the rest of the project, is informal.

A release can happen any time a member of :ref:`core-team` decides it's
time for one and volunteers to serve as Release Manager for the new
release. That person should ask on the rapidsms-dev mailing list whether
anyone objects to creating a new release from the current ``develop``
branch. If no one objects after a day or two, the Release Manager
can proceed to make a new release by following the
:ref:`release-checklist`.
