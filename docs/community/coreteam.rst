The RapidSMS core team
======================

The RapidSMS team is fairly loosely organized. The ``core team`` is
basically anyone who has permission to merge into the official
repository.

The only real prerequisite to joining the core team is showing that
you'd be a useful member of the team.  So, start by
:ref:`contributing <joining>`. After you've done this for a while,
someone on the core team might decide to give you access. If not,
feel free to ask on the ``rapidsms-dev`` list, where by this time
you should be well known anyway.
