Deploying Robust Applications
=============================

*Deployment* is the process of arranging for your application to run on
a server for test or production, as opposed to running on your local
development system, where only you can use it.

We can look at the overall deployment process in three parts:

* Deciding where to run your application - :ref:`deploy_planning`.
* Preparing the server(s) to run your application - :ref:`provisioning`.
* Installing and updating your application to the server(s) - :ref:`deploying`.

The main thing is: stop using runserver and switch over to Apache or your
real server of choice.
