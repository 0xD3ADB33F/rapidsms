RapidSMS 0.12.0 release notes
=============================

Overview
========

Welcome to RapidSMS 0.12.0! These release notes cover the new features in 0.12.0
as well as some `backwards incompatible changes in 0.12.0`_ you'll want to be
aware of when upgrading from RapidSMS 0.11.0.

What's New
==========

Twitter Bootstrap
-----------------

The RapidSMS pages now use `Twitter Bootstrap`_ for a more up-to-date
appearance.

Contrib app updates
-------------------

Most of the contrib apps have been updated to use more up-to-date Django
practices and to add documentation and tests.  A few obsolete apps have
been removed.

FIXME: document the deleted apps

Supporting Django 1.4+
--------------------------

RapidSMS is no longer compatible with any version of Django prior to 1.4.

Backwards-incompatible changes in RapidSMS 0.12.0
=================================================

In the goal of improving the RapidSMS core, we have made a number of backwards-
incompatible changes.

Dropped Django 1.3 support
--------------------------

We decided to drop Django 1.3 support to take advantage of the functionality
offered in Django 1.4+, including `bulk_create`_ and `override_settings`_.
Please read the `Django 1.4 release notes`_ for upgrade instructions.

We believe the most common changes effecting RapidSMS projects will be:

    * Removal of `django.conf.urls.defaults`_

Make the following change to all of your ``urls.py``:

.. code-block:: diff

    -from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    +from django.conf.urls import patterns, url
