What's New

Twitter Bootstrap

The RapidSMS pages now use `Twitter Bootstrap`_ for a more up-to-date
appearance.

.. _backwards incompatible changes in 0.12.0:

Backwards-incompatible changes in RapidSMS 0.12.0
=================================================

In the goal of improving the RapidSMS core, we have made a number of backwards-
incompatible changes.

Dropped Django 1.3 support
--------------------------

We decided to drop Django 1.3 support to take advantage of the functionality
offered in Django 1.4+, including `bulk_create`_ and `override_settings`_.
Please read the `Django 1.4 release notes`_ for upgrade instructions.

We believe the most common changes effecting RapidSMS projects will be:

    * Removal of `django.conf.urls.defaults`_

Make the following change to all of your ``urls.py``:

.. code-block:: diff

    -from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    +from django.conf.urls import patterns, url

RAPIDSMS_TABS setting removed
-----------------------------

The `RAPIDSMS_TABS` setting has been removed. This was used to configure
the list of links displayed at the top of each page when using the RapidSMS
templates. It was not very amenable to customization.

Starting in 0.12.0, the configurable links at the top of the page are
generated by including a template, `rapidsms/_nav_bar.html`, which the
RapidSMS project can override. Typically one would put list items there
containing links.  For example:

.. code-block:: html

    {% load url from future %}
    <li><a href="{% url 'message_log' %}">Message Log</a></li>
    <li><a href="{% url 'registration' %}">Registration</a></li>
    <li><a href="{% url 'messaging' %}">Messaging</a></li>
    <li><a href="{% url 'httptester' %}">Message Tester</a></li>
