RapidSMS 0.12.0 release notes
=============================


.. warning::

    RapidSMS v0.12.0 is currently under development and has not been released.

Welcome to RapidSMS 0.12.0! These release notes cover the new features
in 0.12.0.

Overview
========

Welcome to RapidSMS 0.12.0! These release notes cover the new features in 0.12.0
as well as some `backwards incompatible changes in 0.12.0`_ you'll want to be
aware of when upgrading from RapidSMS 0.11.0.  Most RapidSMS sites and
applications will require some changes when upgrading to RapidSMS 0.12.0.

What's New
==========

Twitter Bootstrap
-----------------

The RapidSMS pages now use `Twitter Bootstrap`_ for a more up-to-date
appearance.  See :doc:`/topics/frontend` for more.

Contrib app updates
-------------------

Most of the contrib apps have been updated to use more up-to-date Django
practices and to add documentation and tests.  A few obsolete apps have
been removed.

The apps that have been removed are:

- rapidsms.contrib.ajax
- rapidsms.contrib.export
- rapidsms.contrib.scheduler

Supporting Django 1.4+
--------------------------

RapidSMS is no longer compatible with any version of Django prior to 1.4.

.. _backwards incompatible changes in 0.12.0:

Backwards-incompatible changes in RapidSMS 0.12.0
=================================================

In the goal of improving the RapidSMS core, we have made a number of backwards-
incompatible changes.

Change to Twitter Bootstrap
---------------------------

With the change to Twitter Bootstrap, the organization of pages has changed.
Simple apps might continue to work okay, but any app that relied on the
previous page structure to control styling or layout might need changes.

Dropped Django 1.3 support
--------------------------

We decided to drop Django 1.3 support to take advantage of the functionality
offered in Django 1.4+, including `bulk_create`_ and `override_settings`_.
Additionally, with the release of Django 1.5, Django 1.3 is no longer
supported by the Django developers.

Please read the `Django 1.4 release notes`_ for upgrade instructions,
especially `Backwards incompatible changes in 1.4`_.

Add Django 1.5 Support
----------------------

RapidSMS 0.12.0 should work correctly with Django 1.5, and we encourage
upgrading to Django 1.5 when possible.

Please read the `Django 1.5 release notes`_ for upgrade instructions,
especially `Backwards incompatible changes in 1.5`_.

We believe the most common changes affecting RapidSMS projects will be:

Removal of `django.conf.urls.defaults`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make the following change to all of your ``urls.py``:

.. code-block:: diff

    -from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    +from django.conf.urls import patterns, url


Change to the url template tag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If any of your templates still use the old url template tag syntax, not
quoting a literal url name, e.g.::

    {% url url-name %}

for Django 1.5 they must be changed to quote the url name (or use
a variable whose value is a url name)::

    {% url 'url-name' %}

If you wish to maintain compability with Django 1.4, you can add
``{% load url from future %}`` near the top of your template, e.g.::

    {% load url from future %}

    {% url 'url-name' %}

which will turn on support for quoted url names in Django 1.4, and be harmless
in later Django releases.


RAPIDSMS_TABS setting removed
-----------------------------

The `RAPIDSMS_TABS` setting has been removed. This was used to configure
the list of links displayed at the top of each page when using the RapidSMS
templates. It was not very amenable to customization.

Starting in 0.12.0, the configurable links at the top of the page are
generated by including a template, `rapidsms/_nav_bar.html`, which the
RapidSMS project can override. Typically one would put list items there
containing links.  For example:

.. code-block:: html

    {% load url from future %}
    <li><a href="{% url 'message_log' %}">Message Log</a></li>
    <li><a href="{% url 'registration' %}">Registration</a></li>
    <li><a href="{% url 'messaging' %}">Messaging</a></li>
    <li><a href="{% url 'httptester' %}">Message Tester</a></li>

Region tags removed
-------------------

These were in the base template.
