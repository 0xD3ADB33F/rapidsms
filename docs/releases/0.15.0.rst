RapidSMS 0.15.0 release notes (next release)
============================================

Welcome to RapidSMS 0.15.0! These release notes cover the new features in 0.15.0

aware of when upgrading from RapidSMS 0.14.0.

What's New

 * :ref:`messages_to_users` are displayed at the top of the page if you're

Backwards-incompatible changes in RapidSMS 0.15.0
=================================================

* Style files removed from base: icons.css, modules.css, splits.css, and
  tables.css. These are no longer used in the new bootstrap-based pages,
  so they've been removed from the RapidSMS base style files and are no longer
  loaded from the base template.

  The old ``locations`` contrib app does still use them, so they've been
  moved into that app and that app's base template changed to load them from
  there.

  If you have an app that's still using any of these styles, and aren't ready
  to convert your app to the new, bootstrap-based look, it's probably
  simplest for you to copy them from ``locations`` into your app and load
  them from your app's base template.
