==========

 * The major changes for 0.15.0 include:

    * Added a :ref:`developing-rapidsms` section that outlines how to contribute to the RapidSMS codebase.
 * :ref:`messages_to_users` are displayed at the top of the page if you're
   using the RapidSMS base template.

   are loaded. :setting:`INSTALLED_HANDLERS`, :setting:`EXCLUDED_HANDLERS`,
   and :setting:`RAPIDSMS_HANDLERS_EXCLUDE_APPS` are deprecated, and
   :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` are no longer searched automatically for
   handlers. For more information see :ref:`handlers-discovery`.
 * Added example of :ref:`submitting`.
 * Test class documentation now includes inheritance references. See :class:`rapidsms.tests.harness.RapidTest` for an example.
 * Expanded documentation on :ref:`contacts`.
 * Added a documentation stub for :ref:`packaging reusable apps <packaging>`.
